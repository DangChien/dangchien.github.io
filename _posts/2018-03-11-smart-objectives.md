What does `SMART` mean? `SMART` is an acronym that you can use to guide your goal setting. `SMART` has come to mean different things to different people, as shown below. To make sure your goals are clear and reachable, each one should be:

<!--more-->[ ](#){:id="more"}

- `S`pecific (simple, sensible, significant).
  + Who: Who is involved in this goal?
  + What: What do I want to accomplish?
  + Where: Where is this goal to be achieved? Where is it located?
  + When: When do I want to achieve this goal?
  + Why: Why do I want to achieve this goal? Why is this important?
  + Which resources or limits are involved?
- `M`easurable (meaningful, motivating).
  + How much?
  + How many?
  + How will I know when it is accomplished?
  + What is my indicator of progress?
- `A`chievable (agreed, attainable).
  + Do I have the resources and capabilities to achieve the goal? If not, what am I missing?
  + How can I accomplish this goal? Have others done it successfully before?
  + How realistic is the goal, based on other constraints, such as financial factors?
- `R`elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
  + Is the goal realistic and within reach?
  + Is the goal reachable given the time and resources?
  + Are you able to commit to achieving the goal?
  + Does this seem worthwhile?
  + Is this the right time?
  + Does this match our other efforts/needs?
  + Am I the right person to reach this goal?
  + Is it applicable in the current socio-economic environment?
- `T`ime-Bound (timely, time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).
  + When? Does my goal have a deadline?
  + By when do you want to achieve your goal?
    * What can I do six months from now?
    * What can I do six weeks from now?
    * What can I do today?

An example of how to set a SMART goal:

{:.table}
| *Item* | *Description* |
|:-|:-|
| Problem | Many people are accessing our company website from their mobile devices. Since it’s not a responsive website, it provides a poor experience for customers. |

Asking yourself the following questions:

{:.table}
| *Item* | *Description* |
|:-|:-|
| Specific | I want to launch a mobile app to support my company business activities by the end of Q2, which requires involvement from software development, design, and marketing. |
| Measurable | Creating a mobile app for our company will require a lot of resources. To make it worthwhile, I’d like to have 50,000 app installations  within six months after launch. I’d also like to show a 5% conversion rate from customers using the mobile website. |
| Achievable | The departments that will be involved have signed-off on creating a mobile app. I’ll need to manage the project and set milestones to keep everyone motivated and on target |
| Relevant | Improving the customer experience on mobile devices is a core initiative for my company this year since this is mobile first era. |
| Time-Bound | In order to achieve 50,000 app installations and a 5% conversion rate by the end of the fiscal year, the app will need to be launched by Q2 with a robust marketing campaign that should continue through the end of the year. |

Some people even have expanded it to include extra focus areas, for example `SMARTER`, which includes:

- `E`valuate
- `R`eview

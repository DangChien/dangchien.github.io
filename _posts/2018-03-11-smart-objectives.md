What does `SMART` mean? `SMART` is an acronym that you can use to guide your goal setting. `SMART` has come to mean different things to different people, as shown below. To make sure your goals are clear and reachable, each one should be:

<!--more-->[ ](#){:id="more"}

- `S`pecific (simple, sensible, significant).
  - What do I want to accomplish?
  - Why is this goal important?
  - Who is involved?
  - Where is it located?
  - Which resources or limits are involved?
- `M`easurable (meaningful, motivating).
  - How much?
  - How many?
  - How will I know when it is accomplished?
- `A`chievable (agreed, attainable).
  - How can I accomplish this goal?
  - How realistic is the goal, based on other constraints, such as financial factors?
- `R`elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
  - Does this seem worthwhile?
  - Is this the right time?
  - Does this match our other efforts/needs?
  - Am I the right person to reach this goal?
  - Is it applicable in the current socio-economic environment?
- `T`ime-Bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).
  - When?
  - What can I do six months from now?
  - What can I do six weeks from now?
  - What can I do today?

An example of how to set a SMART goal:

{:.table}
| *Item* | *Description* |
|:-|:-|
| Problem | Many people are accessing our company website from their mobile devices. Since it’s not a responsive website, it provides a poor experience for customers. |

Asking yourself the following questions:

{:.table}
| *Item* | *Description* |
|:-|:-|
| Specific | I want to launch a mobile app to support my company business activities by the end of Q2, which requires involvement from software development, design, and marketing. |
| Measurable | Creating a mobile app for our company will require a lot of resources. To make it worthwhile, I’d like to have 50,000 app installations  within six months after launch. I’d also like to show a 5% conversion rate from customers using the mobile website. |
| Achievable | The departments that will be involved have signed-off on creating a mobile app. I’ll need to manage the project and set milestones to keep everyone motivated and on target |
| Relevant | Improving the customer experience on mobile devices is a core initiative for my company this year since this is mobile first era. |
| Time-Bound | In order to achieve 50,000 app installations and a 5% conversion rate by the end of the fiscal year, the app will need to be launched by Q2 with a robust marketing campaign that should continue through the end of the year. |

Some people even have expanded it to include extra focus areas, for example `SMARTER`, which includes:

- `E`valuate
- `R`eview

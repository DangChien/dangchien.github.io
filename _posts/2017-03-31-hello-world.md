Recently I stumbled upon a book named [Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612), and with the inspiration of a friend I decide to `hire` this blog to share and to discuss random topics that arise in my daily life as a software engineer.

I will start off with a `S`pecific, `M`easurable, `A`greeable, `R`ealistic and `T`ime-based goal for this blog

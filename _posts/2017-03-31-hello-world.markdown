Recently I stumbled upon a book named [Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612), I decide to `hire` this blog to share and to discuss random topics that arise in a typical day of software engineer.

First, I will start off with a baby step and this will be my personal goal for this blog:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary">
  <p>Consolidate, compose and publish at least one blog post per every two months.</p>
</div>

Cheers.

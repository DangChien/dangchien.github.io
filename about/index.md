Software development is my profession & passion, and I am constantly in the lookout for the best practices, techniques and tools to do it effectively. As a software engineer and solution architect, I am spending most of my time in crafting and designing software systems with 3 criteria in mind: useful, great in performance, easy to maintain and scale. I am a fan of agile approaches and the resulting focus on evolutionary software architecture.
